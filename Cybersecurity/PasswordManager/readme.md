I will learn about encryption and file handling by making a simple password manager. 

This program will have two options, A) Sign up, and B) sign in:

A) Sign up

1) Users will enter a username and password combo.

2) Program will encrypt password.

3) Program will write username/encrypted password combo to passwords.txt.

B) 

1) User enters username.

2) User enters password.

3) Program checks to see if password matches what's in "database." 
----

Example usernames and encrypted passwords will appear in example_output.txt, while real output will be stored in credentials.cpp which I will exclude from version control using .gitignore. This is to A) familiarize myself with .gitignore, and B) to develop good habits and prevent bad ones.
